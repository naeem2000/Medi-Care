    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>These terms and conditions set out the terms of use that apply to the web application(s), including any updates, that we make available through our website(respectively, Application and Website) and also the terms of service that apply to any of the services accessible through any such Application or through any application that we make available for download from any third party application store (collectively, Services).
        
        BY ACCESSING AND/OR USING ANY APPLICATION OR SERVICE, YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY CONSTITUTE A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT BETWEEN US AND YOU (AND, IF RELEVANT, ANY ORGANISATION ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU ARE ACTING). IF YOU ARE ACTING ON BEHALF OF ANY ORGANISATION, YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE THE REQUISITE AUTHORITY, POWER AND RIGHT TO FULLY BIND THAT ORGANISATION. IF YOU (OR, IF RELEVANT, YOUR ORGANISATION) DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS (OR IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO BIND YOUR ORGANISATION), YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO ACCESS OR USE ANY APPLICATION OR SERVICE, AND YOU SHOULD NOT PROCEED FURTHER.
        
        In these terms and conditions, unless the context otherwise requires, all further references to you (and your, etc) means both you as an individual user and also the organisation on whose behalf you are acting (if any).
        
        We reserve the right to change the terms of these terms and conditions from time to time by changing them on the Website and notifying you (with the updated terms being displayed on-screen or with a link to the updated terms) when you next start the Application.
        <br>
        <h3>Access to the Applications and Services</h3>
        <br>
        Applications may only be accessed and used on a device owned or controlled by you and running the relevant operating system for which the Application concerned was designed, so you must make sure you have a compatible device which meets all the necessary technical specifications to enable you to use any Application you wish to access.
        
        Applications (or upgrades) you access and Services you request by registering to create an account with us (see Account set-up), are made available to you immediately and you acknowledge and agree that this is the case and that, therefore, you will have no right to change your mind and cancel under the Consumer Contracts Regulations (sometimes known as a ‘cooling off’ right) once you access the Application or you register to create your account (as the case may be).
        
        You will be assumed to have obtained permission from the owner of any device that is controlled, but not owned, by you to access an Application from that device. You accept responsibility, in accordance with these terms and conditions, for all access to, and use of, any Application by you on any device, whether or not it is owned by you.
        
        You acknowledge that the mobile service provider for any mobile device on which you access or use any Application or Service may charge for internet access (including mobile data usage) on that device.
        
        We cannot and do not guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted or error-free operability of any Application or Service or that any Application or Service will respond at a certain speed (since this depends on a number of factors outside our control).
        <br>
        <h3>Account set-up</h3>
        <br>
        Certain features, functions or content of, or Services accessible through, an Application are restricted to users who have an account with us. You can register to create either through the relevant Application or on the Website. You are not obliged to have an account with us, but if you do not do so, you will be unable to use the applicable features, functions or content of, or access the applicable Services through, the relevant Application. To register to create an account with us, you must provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information, including legal name, and, in the case of a paid-for Service subscription, full contact information. You are responsible for the information you provide to us. You must promptly inform of all changes to this information.
        
        If you choose, or you are provided with, a password (or other identifier) for accessing or using your account and/or any Service, you must treat such information as confidential and must not reveal it to anyone else. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your password and must notify us immediately of any unauthorised use of which you become aware. We reserve the right to disable any password at any time, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these terms and conditions or if any details you provide for the purposes of registering as a user prove to be false.
        
        You must cease to use and delete your password from any of your records upon termination of your account, for whatever reason.
        
        Paid-for Service subscriptions
        Each of the available paid-for Service subscriptions will require you to pay a fee, the amount of which will be as set out on the Website. The fee you pay gives you access to the relevant features, functions and/or content for the level of Service requested by you from amongst the available options indicated on the Website. Subscription fees are payable monthly, unless we offer the option to pre-pay for a longer period, such as six or 12 months (as indicated on the Website).
        
        Payment must be made by credit or debit card. We accept payment by most major credit and debit cards. You should be aware that online payment transactions are subject to validation checks by your card issuer and we are not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorise payment for any reason. Please note, it is possible that your card issuer may charge you an online handling fee or processing fee. We are not responsible for this.
        
        It is important to note that your subscription will automatically renew (as long as we continue to make the relevant Service subscription available) every month (or, in the case of a longer subscription, at the end of the relevant period), at the then-current fee (as indicated on the Website) unless you cancel your subscription through the cancellation functionality provided for your account on the Website. We will notify you, by email and on the Website, of any increase in the applicable fees.
        
        We warrant that paid-for Services will be provided with reasonable care and skill.
        <br>
